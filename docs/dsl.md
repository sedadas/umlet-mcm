# Mapping between DSL files and the domain models

## DSL files

What we call DSL (Domain-Specific Language) files are XML-based files used as a medium for persisting models. These files follow a specific XML grammar formally defined in the XSD files located in `mcm-backend/mcm-core/src/main/resources/dsl`.

The grammar was designed such as these files can be displayed for comparisons, and so easily understandable by the user. 

### Elements

#### Model

#### Node

#### Relation

#### Metadata

The Metadata bloc is not meant to be shown to the user, therefore all information that doesn't bring any semantic information are stored there.
